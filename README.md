# Enterprise SOC Lab – AWS Security Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview

A production-style cloud security lab implementing segmented VPC architecture, centralized log aggregation, and real-world attack simulation to develop SOC and cloud security engineering capabilities.

# 🛡 Enterprise Cloud SOC Lab (AWS)

A production-style cloud security lab designed to simulate real-world SOC operations using segmented AWS infrastructure, centralized log aggregation, and controlled attack simulation.

This project documents the phased build of a cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC), focusing on secure network architecture, detection engineering fundamentals, and incident response workflows.
